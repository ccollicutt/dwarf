Dwarf is a small tool to manage virtual machines similarly to the way Nova
does but restricted to the local machine. Dwarf provides a subset of the same
CLI commands as the Nova client and tries to emulate Nova behavior as closely
as possible. It only runs on Linux using KVM as the hypervisor.

Since it's not packaged yet, things need to be setup manually prior to using
Dwarf:

1) Install libvirt and KVM and virsh and virt-manager and all those goodies.
   Make sure the permissions are set correctly so that a regular user can
   launch VMs in 'system' mode, i.e. 'virsh --connect=qemmu:///system' needs to
   work for the user who wants to run Dwarf.

2) Run the 'tools/setup' script to add the Dwarf user and directory and give
   a regular user permissions to run Dwarf. Run it like this
   'sudo tools/setup <username>' where <username> is the name of the user who
   wants to run Dwarf.

3) Initialize the Dwarf environment by running 'bin/dwarf env-init'.

Now you should be ready to use Dwarf. Run 'bin/dwarf -h' for a list of
supported commands. The names and usages of the commands are copied from the
Nova client with slight variations where they are required.

For example, to boot an instance, one can specify a local image file rather
than an ID from an image catalog, i.e.:
$ bin/dwarf boot --image-file ./test-image.qcow2 server1
